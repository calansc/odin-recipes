        <img class='yum' src="https://hungryhappens.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/JPEG-image-199-6-720x960.jpeg" alt="Delicious Crispy Spicy Salmon Bowl">
        <p>No need to track down sushi grade salmon. We are cubing, seasoning and cooking our salmon pieces in under 15 minutes and they will taste better than restaurant bought sushi bowls. My favorite part of this recipe is, of course, the sauce, which brings everything together.</p>
