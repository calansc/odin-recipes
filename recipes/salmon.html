        <p>No need to track down sushi grade salmon. We are cubing, seasoning and cooking our salmon pieces in under 15 minutes and they will taste better than restaurant bought sushi bowls. My favorite part of this recipe is, of course, the sauce, which brings everything together.</p>

        <h3>rice:</h3>
        <ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>rice:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook your rice according to package instructions. In a small pot, warm your rice vinegar, sugar and salt until just about to boil and then remove from the burner. Transfer your COOKED rice to a platter, evenly pour the mixture on top and fluff with a fork.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>salmon:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove the skin from your salmon. Pat dry the fish with a paper towel. Cube the salmon into 1.5 inch chunks. Season the pieces with the seasonings – generously. Toss them to spread it all over the pieces.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, working in 2 batches, heat 2 tbs sesame oil on medium high. Add HALF the salmon and cook for 3-4 minutes per side, gently turning. Internal temperature of salmon should be no less than 145°F. Transfer cooked salmon to paper towel lined platter. Wipe down your pan clean and repeat with remaining oil and salmon.</li>
        </ol>

            <li>Whisk all of the ingredients together until smooth.</li>
